# S67_Capstone_Bookhive

BookHive is a reader-focused platform that helps users organize, explore, and review books.  Readers can manage their books in three categories‚ÄîPast Readings, Current Reading, and Wanna Read. The Search Section allows users to find books by genre, offering suggestions (but not full access to books). In the Discover Section, users can explore different genres. Readers can also rate and review books, making it easier for others to find great reads

Project Goal:
To build BookHive, a reader-centric platform that enables users to organize their reading lists, explore books by genre, and share their thoughts through reviews and ratings. The platform will also include virtual book clubs, JWT + Google OAuth authentication, and separate views for readers and moderators. The tech stack includes MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
